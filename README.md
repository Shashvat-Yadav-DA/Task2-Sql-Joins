# Task 4 – SQL Joins (PostgreSQL)

## Project Overview

This task demonstrates the use of SQL joins in PostgreSQL for data analysis and reporting. It showcases how to handle relational data to extract meaningful business information.

## Features

* **INNER JOIN**: Merging records with matching values in both tables.
* **LEFT JOIN**: Including all records from the primary table and matched records from the secondary table.
* **Revenue Analysis**: Using SQL logic to calculate and analyze financial data.
* **Exporting Results**: Converting SQL query outputs into CSV format for external reporting.

## Files Included

* **joins_queries.sql**: Contains all SQL scripts and join logic used in the project.
* **joined_output.csv**: The final dataset generated after executing the joins.
* **insights.txt**: Documented business insights derived from the analyzed data.

## Tools Used

* **PostgreSQL**: The relational database management system.
* **pgAdmin 4**: The graphical interface used for database management and query execution.

## Description

This project focuses on combining multiple tables using SQL joins to create a unified view of data. By linking different datasets, I performed a comprehensive revenue analysis and prepared the results for business reporting by exporting the final output into a CSV format.
